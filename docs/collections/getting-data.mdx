# Getting Data from a Collection

To get data from a collection, do:

`collection.findDocumentByID(id)` or anything else that will get a document.

Then, whatever you have saved the document under, do

`doc.data.name`

doc.data.name should return the name you put in the data when inserting the document.

Example Usage:

```js
let doc = collection.findFirst({name: 'Example Name'})

console.log(doc.data.name)
```

```bash
Example Name
```
